'''
Single objective functions

All objective functions must accept a Í„(numpy.ndarray) with shape
(n_particles, dimensions). Each row represents a  particle, and
each column represents its position on a specific dimension of
the search-space.

functions must return an array of size (n_particles, )
that contains all the computed fitness for each particle.
